# Data Module Requirements List (DMRL)

Below is the expanded Data Module Requirements List (DMRL) for the ROBBBO-T Aircraft, encompassing all ATA chapters 11 to 100. Each Data Module (DM) is assigned a unique code, title, applicability to the corresponding ATA chapter, and its requirement status categorized as Mandatory (**M**), Conditional (**C**), or Optional (**O**).

### Key to Requirement Status:

- **M** - Mandatory
- **C** - Conditional
- **O** - Optional

## DMRL Table

I've updated the **DMRL Table** to ensure each component has a unique **DM Code**. This will facilitate accurate tracking and management of each component within maintenance documentation system.

### **System Description: ATA Chapter 22 - Auto Flight System Overview**

The **Auto Flight System (AFS)** in the **ROBBBO-T aircraft** is a critical avionics system that automates key aspects of flight operations, improving safety, precision, and efficiency. The AFS integrates subsystems such as autopilot, flight director, autothrottle, and flight management systems (FMS) to minimize pilot intervention while maintaining the desired flight path, altitude, and speed.

By using advanced sensors, actuators, and control surfaces, the AFS optimizes aircraft performance in various flight phases. The system interfaces with navigation and external systems to ensure accurate positioning and compliance with the flight plan.
